               Across Scotland, around 800,000 adults don’t have the basic digital skills they need to use the internet effectively. If this were just a case of missing out on a few distracting websites and celebrity tweets then we might think nothing more of it. But the stakes are so much higher. Amongst other things, the internet helps people keep in touch, learn new things, save money, find work and stay healthy. For some people it’s been a genuine life saver. These things matter to everyone, and they should be for everyone.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Research shows that the people offline are more likely to be facing other forms of exclusion and inequality. They may be older, have a disability or low income. Evidence also tells us that developing the motivation and skills are just as important as enabling access to equipment and broadband connections. Supporting more people to go online and develop basic digital skills is crucial to ensure existing inequalities are not increased.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                Digital is also becoming increasingly seen as a primary route for engagement and activity across government and business. UK, national and local government are investing significantly in enhancing digital infrastructure and making public services ‘digital first’. This not only helps to meet citizens’ expectations of how they should be able to engage with services in the Internet era, but also offers big opportunities to reduce costs while increasing efficiency and effectiveness.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                So the need for investment in basic digital skills for everyone is clear. We want Scotland to become a world-leading digital nation by 2020 – and we’re asking you to join us in making that happen.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n</div>",

The women have varying levels of English which has meant that we have had to develop our existing learning materials so that they were suitable for ESOL learners. We have also developed additional learning material to meet their needs.</p><p>The learners are very motivated, coming in early to get extra practice and not stopping for a break. We recruited 6 learners initially with a further 4 in the process of recruitment at the moment. 3 learners have now passed their Microsoft Basic Digital Literacy certificates and are now ready to continue at a different class to improve their Microsoft Word skills.</p><p>The project has a significant impact on the women we support, giving them the skills to enable them to search for & obtain work, access public & consumer services, pay bills, search for cost savings for utilities & goods, have social contact with others & even keep up with their children’s activities online.</p><p>Giving people the skills they are expected to have automatically by the welfare system, enables them to meet Jobcentre expectations & help avoid the possibility of sanctions which are having a major impact on people living in poverty.”</p></div>\n            <hr class=\"margin-top\" />\n        </div>\n        {{else}}\n        {{#compare params.slug \"===\" \"glasgow-life\"}}\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-6 mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-4-phone\">\n            <h3>“Our frontline staff have the skills and knowledge to weave relevant digital learning elements into the work they are already doing with harder to reach groups”</h3>\n            <p>&#8212; <strong><a href=\"/signatories/glasgow-life\">Glasgow Life</a></strong></p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell hide-on-small-only mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-1\">\n            &nbsp;\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell hide-on-small-only m5\">\n            <div class=\"pull-right expand\">\n                <h3>\n                    <a href=\"/stories\">\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-times-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n                    </a>\n                </h3>\n            </div>\n            <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/digitalparticipation/images/illustrations/WEB-Skill-Up-(Creating).png\" alt=\"Glasgow Life story page illustration\" class=\"responsive-img margin-top\" />\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12\">\n            <div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Glasgow Life built basic digital skills for both workforce and service users, through a six month Digital Internship post.

The content was based on the ’23 Things’ approach originally developed for Information Professionals and more recently adopted by the Scottish Government Library as a digital learning approach for civil servants.</p><p>In terms of outputs we have to date delivered training for 40 frontline workers. The training materials are currently being reviewed and expanded following feedback from the first tranche of trainees and will commence again in Autumn 2016 after a workforce rationalisation process has concluded.</p><p>We created an online (Moodle based – in partnership with Glasgow Kelvin College) learning resource which will continue to develop and expand.</p><p>In terms of outcomes for the people and groups we care about, this project has ensured that our frontline staff have the skills and knowledge to weave relevant digital learning elements into the work they are already doing with harder to reach groups – exposing these learners (often for the first time) to the advantages and learning resources available online.”</p></div>\n            <hr class=\"margin-top\" />\n        </div>\n        {{else}}\n        {{#compare params.slug \"===\" \"queens-cross\"}}\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12 m6\">\n            <h3>“We worked to engage older people with the internet”</h3>\n            <p>&#8212; <strong><a href=\"\">Queens Cross Housing Association</a></strong></p>\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell hide-on-small-only mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-1\">\n            &nbsp;\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell hide-on-small-only m5\">\n            <div class=\"pull-right expand\">\n                <h3>\n                    <a href=\"/stories\">\n                        <i class=\"fa fa-times-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n                    </a>\n                </h3>\n            </div>\n            <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/digitalparticipation/images/illustrations/WEB-Skill-Up-(Creating).png\" alt=\"Queens Cross Housing Association story page illustration\" class=\"responsive-img margin-top\" />\n        </div>\n        <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12\">\n            <div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Queens Cross Housing Association got older people engaged in learning how to use the internet through researching their local history</strong></p><p>They said:</p><p>“We worked to engage older people with the internet by harnessing their interest in social history and genealogy.
