<p>\n        Across Scotland, around 800,000 adults don’t have the essential digital skills they need to use the internet effectively. If this were just a case of missing out on a few distracting websites and celebrity tweets then we might think nothing more of it. But the stakes are so much higher. Amongst other things, the internet helps people keep in touch, learn new things, save money, find work and stay healthy. For some people it’s been a genuine life saver. These things matter to everyone, and they should be for everyone.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Research shows that the people offline are more likely to be facing other forms of exclusion and inequality. They may be older, have a disability or low income. Evidence also tells us that developing the motivation and skills are just as important as enabling access to equipment and broadband connections. Supporting more people to go online and develop essential digital skills is crucial to ensure existing inequalities are not increased.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        Digital is also becoming increasingly seen as a primary route for engagement and activity across government and business. UK, national and local government are investing significantly in enhancing digital infrastructure and making public services ‘digital first’. This not only helps to meet citizens’ expectations of how they should be able to engage with services in the Internet era, but also offers big opportunities to reduce costs while increasing efficiency and effectiveness.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        So the need for investment in essential digital skills for everyone is clear. We want Scotland to become a world-leading digital nation by 2020 – and we’re asking you to join us in making that happen.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>",

To try and tackle this, they offer a Tech Library, which gives people access to devices they can take home for up to two weeks at a time. They are working with technology suppliers to try and give tenants and their local community access to low cost, high speed broadband and are looking at moving some of their “traditional” services to more digital channels, such as an online portal and mobile app.</p><p>Rory Brown joined Govan Housing Association in 2017 as a Digital Inclusion Worker and since then has been working with tenants and other local organisations to increase access and break down digital barriers.</p><p>He initially started by organising a digital forum, gathering opinions and views from tenants and people in the Govan community, moving forward in 2018, he is hoping to extend this to include new digital projects and partnership events.</p><p>Currently Rory runs three digital hubs providing free access to computers, scanners and tablets with the opportunity to receive training and support in an informal and friendly environment. He is also hoping, with the support of Govan HA, to run digital pop up events. These events will aim to be engaging, fun and informative and will cover a range of topics such as virtual reality, gaming, music, arts, apps and workshops.</p><p>As an organisation, Govan HA are aware that one of the main barriers to digital participation continues to be confidence and motivation and are trying to tackle this by providing support to tenants on a one to one basis, even including home visits in this. They are also working with other social housing landlords in the South West of Glasgow to look at the potential of establishing a community Wi-Fi service.</p><p>Finally, Govan HA are committed to helping their workforce become more digitally aware and as part of this run in-house tech demos where staff can try new gadgets and technology and can also ask for support with their own devices.</p></div>\n      <hr class=\"margin-top\" />\n    </div>\n    {{else}}\n    {{#compare request.params.slug \"===\" \"cre8te-opportunites\"}}\n    <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-6 mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-4-phone\">\n      <h3>“Giving people the skills they are expected to have automatically by the welfare system enables them to meet Jobcentre expectations &amp; help avoid the possibility of sanctions, which are having a major impact on people living in poverty”</h3>\n      <p>&#8212; <strong><a href=\"/signatories/cre8te-opportunities-limited\">Cre8te Opportunities Limited</a></strong></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell hide-on-small-only mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-1\">\n      &nbsp;\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell hide-on-small-only m5\">\n      <div class=\"pull-right expand\">\n        <h3>\n          <a href=\"/stories\">\n            <i class=\"fa fa-times-circle\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></i>\n          </a>\n        </h3>\n      </div>\n      <img src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/digitalparticipation/images/illustrations/WEB-Skill-Up-(Creating).png\" alt=\"Cre8te Opportunities Limited story page illustration\" class=\"responsive-img margin-top\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12\">\n      <div class=\"content\"><p><strong>Cre8te ran FEMDA, the ‘Female Ethnic Minority Digital Academy’, in conjunction with the charity Saheliya.</strong></p><p>They said:</p><p>“We recruited for our first group of learners by holding assessments to make sure the class was the right thing for them.
