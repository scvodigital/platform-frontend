          Funding Scotland exists to help charities, community groups and social enterprises find the money they need to realise their vision. From small grants to funding for big capital projects, we can help you track down the funding you need. We provide information on over 1200 funds which support Scottish projects. Funding Scotland only lists funders with a track record of supporting projects in Scotland. It includes grants, loans, prizes and other support. It does not include funding opportunities for individuals or private businesses. This website is owned and maintained by the <a href="https://scvo.org">Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations</a>, champions of the third sector in Scotland.
